* New Feature - Right clicking on cards in a game or the deck editor will now show a bigger version of that card.
* Drafts will now only contain cards from the Standard Set in multiplayer. We originally planned to make this change only when there was a Legacy format, but we've found Legacy cards are disproportionately bugged and learning them adds an extra hurdle for new players.
* Starlight Pendant
    * The Amber indicator in the main menu is now replaced with a pendant indicator if you own the pendant.
    * Pendant owners are now automatically granted the "Welcome to My Shop!" achievement.
* Improved the animations during mulligans.
* Rules: Cards that start in your hand (after mulligans) will now trigger changed zones triggers once. This won't trigger card drawn triggers. E.g. Wormhole Investigator will now be a 1/1 if he's in your opening hand, like you would expect.
* Improved button colors on certain game boards.
* Fixed bug in Sentinels where the enemies on the map screen overflow off the screen on 16:10 resolutions.
* Fixed several crashes.
