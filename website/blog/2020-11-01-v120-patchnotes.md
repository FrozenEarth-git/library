## Introducing the Bird Doctors

Three new Heroes have been added to the game: Baldwin (Strength), Hawkins (Spirit), and Lazaro (Mind). Each of them are designed around tribal type synergy, giving players the power to develop new archetypes for these Heroes through the card submission process. The Bird Doctors share a common pool of emotes.

## New Emotes

We've released our remaining bank of Hero emotes, both the ones that were missing from the Season 2 Season Pass, and many others that are available in the Shop. This includes a "GG" emote for each hero.

## Kyung Mi Balance

We've updated Kyung Mi's outfit swap effects to the following:

- Strength: Give a Strength unit in play or in your hand +1 ATK and Duelist.
- Spirit: Give a Spirit unit in play or your hand +1 HP and "Entomb: Draw a card."
- Mind: Your next Mind card costs 1 less.

## Bug Fixes

- There have been many reports of Ward disappearing without an obvious cause. We don't believe this is a core rules issue, and is instead an issue with how a few problematic cards are blocked. However, there was a bug where effects that pop Ward weren't showing up in the game log. Fixing that issue will make it much easier to find and fix the cards causing this issue.
