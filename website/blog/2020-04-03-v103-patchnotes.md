-  We've added an AI opponent fallback for PVP matches. Playing against the AI this way will give both quest progress and Weekly Wins, just like normal PVP matches.
    - You can turn this feature off in the settings if you only want to be matched against humans.
    - Playing against the AI doesn't affect your rank.
- New Hotkeys
    - Esc now opens the system menu.
    - Enter now toggles the autopass button.
- Rules Engine - Fixed some issues involving sorted groups, e.g. Obsidian Paladin’s cost not updating.
- Fixed a bug in the deck editor when switching between decks and choosing to discard your changes where it appeared your changes to the previous deck appeared to be saved.
- Fixed a bug where the game would break for players with long load times.
- Changed when certain assets are loaded to reduce load times for the game board.
- Known Issue: Twice Undead won’t give itself Rebound.
