We've increased the amount of Amber new players get by completing the tutorial to 2000 (was 1050). Existing players will get the difference via an alert the next time they log in.

## Other Changes
- New start-of-turn sound
- The "Play 10 Multiplayer games" new player achievement is now "Play 10 Versus or Colosseum games."
