### Collection Page

[https://www.collective.gg/collection](https://www.collective.gg/collection)

We've grouped the card release sets into eras, rather than simply numbering them by week. The eras are:
- Ancient Times - Week 1 - 52
- The Old Days - Week 53 - 84
- Preseason - Week 85 until Steam launch

Additionally, Legacy Set cards are now hidden behind a toggle at the bottom of the page. The toggle will remember your preference.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the AI taking a really long time to decide attackers when the board is full.
- Fixed a bug that caused certain animations to be duplicated, such as seen on the stream on Friday with Aria, Astral Witch.
- Fixed a bug where the player could get tutorial 4 into an incompletable state.
