### Quick Developer Update

We were originally planning to release a Hero around this time, but we've been very busy since the launch addressing issues and planning for the future, as well as recuperating from the sprint to get the game out. The next Hero will be released at the start of Season 2 on July 3rd. The last four emote rewards on the Season Pass were originally going to be emotes for the new Hero, but since there isn't one, we've replaced them with a few new emotes for existing Heroes.

### Cosmetics

- 4 New Emotes (included in Premium Season Pass)
- New Card Frame: AESTHETICA
