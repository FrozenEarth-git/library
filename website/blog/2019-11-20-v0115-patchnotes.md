- Changed how Mulligans work so they don't rely on the (removed) Undo button.
- Improved and shorted animations when playing cards.
- Dragging cards out to play them is much more reliable, especially if you're doing it quickly.
- Fixed a bug that would cause you to autopass when you have 0 mana, but have a 0 mana card in your hand.
- If a Blueprint purchase fails, it should no longer lock the client permanently.
- Fixed an issue where the friends list wasn't populating (AKA Mr. Friendo bug).
