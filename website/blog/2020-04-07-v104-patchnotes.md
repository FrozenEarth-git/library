For new player convenience and security, we're moving to primarily signing players in through their Steam account.

* You'll still need a Collective account to use the Card Creator.
* You can still switch Collective accounts inside the game client, you'll just need to unlink your Steam account in Settings.

### Other Changes

* Updated the Sentinels and Story Mode UI's to be clearer and provide better progress indicators.
* Fixed a bug in the Sentinels UI where the enemy preview would cover the buttons.
* Fixed some crashes.
