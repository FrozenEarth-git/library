title: V0.12.6 - Rotation Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug where Legacy cards would show up in Astral Gauntlet picks.
    - We won't be forcing players to start new AG runs. _We don't think having a pre-rotation deck is a much of an advantage, and it's an extra feature we don't have time to implement right now._
- Added Legacy as an option for the target mode of a deck, making it easier to build singleplayer decks.
- Fixed bugs that prevented Legacy cards from being playable in the Card Creator or the tutorial.
- Updated the starting decks for the free Heroes.
    - All players will get the blueprints of any cards in the new starting decks.

Below you can find the new starting deck lists. If you want to use one (since you're guaranteed to own the blueprints):

1) Copy the text to your clip board
1) Open the deck editor
1) Open a deck slot for the hero
1) Mouse over the hero portrait to access the deck editor menu
1) Click Import from Clipboard.
