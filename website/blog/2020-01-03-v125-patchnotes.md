Today is Collective's first rotation. We'll be moving the first 52 weeks of cards and the Core Set into the Legacy Set, as described in the [Rotation 2020 blog post](/library/blog/2019-12-08-rotation-2020).

- Added a toggle in the deck builder in the advanced filters to show Legacy cards.
- Legacy cards are legal only in singleplayer modes for now.
