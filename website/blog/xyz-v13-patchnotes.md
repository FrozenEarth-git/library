### Daily Quests, Season Pass, and Achievements

- Daily Quests have been revamped. They now have more varied objectives, and none of them require winning games.
    - Winning a multiplayer game will double any daily quest progress made during that game.
- The Season Pass system has been added.
    - Daily quests now give Season Points instead of currencies.
    - Your first 15 multiplayer wins each week also give some Season Points. This accounts for about 20% of possible Season Points earned each week.
    - Every 1000 Season Points you earn unlocks a tier of the Season Pass, granting an amount of a currency, or a cosmetic.
    - The Premium Season Pass will become available when we launch on Steam (Date still to be announced).
    - Once you've completed the Season Pass, daily quests and weekly wins will award Gold and Amber.
- Added over a dozen new achievements, and reorganized them into categories.
