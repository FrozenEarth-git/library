- Added Rage as a keyword.

## Economy Changes

- Added a number of achievements designed to guide new players after they finish the tutorial, and a few more general ones. All players can take advantage of the new achievements to get a big chunk of Gold and Amber.
    - The Season 1 achievements are placeholders.
    - _For those keeping score at home from our [previous blog post](/blog/2019-12-12-economy-overview), the 1000 Amber mentioned in the New Player Rewards was already given by the tutorial, so it won't come from the new achievements._
- Daily quest progress has been reset because the system changed internally. To compensate, everyone will immediately be given 3 new daily quests.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a font rendering issue that sometimes made deck names unreadable.
- Fixed an issue where the next Colosseum enemy wouldn't show.
- Fixed an issue where the complete daily quest animation would play repeatedly.
- Fixed a game freeze.

### Other

- The AI should no longer use high cost removal on small units.
- The Discord bot now has a `!bug` command, which simply prints an explanation about how to report a bug in the game client. This is meant to be helpful for new players.
- Changed the flavor text font in the game client to match the one in the Card Creator.
