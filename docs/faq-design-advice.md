Here you can find advice on how to design a card that's most likely to get into the game. These are just suggestions -- as long as your card doesn't break any rules, its up to the community.

## How do I get my first card in?

We wrote an article giving general advice you can find [here](/blog/2018/10/02/design/), highlighting some early innovators in creating cards. The short version is, there are many ways to get a card in, and being a good artist is only one of them.

We also recommend providing [Commentary](rules-commenting.md#commentary) for your card to explain why you made it.

## How can I develop an archetype?

This is something we see a lot of people try to do. Very few people come into card games wanting to make individual cards; usually, they have an idea for a whole deck, or a set of cards which work together, either thematically or mechanically.

We recommend spending a bit of time thinking about your archetype before trying to submit cards for it. One of the best examples of this we've seen was [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/collectivecg/comments/a0zbuy/some_vox_support_card_ideas/). Benefits include:

- Communicates your ideas to people who primarily read Reddit (Note: the [Discord](https://discord.gg/c8ftnvt) server will undoubtedly see your post and talk about it even if you don't post there; on the other hand, discussions on Discord are often overlooked, and rarely make it to Reddit)
- May explain lore, Realm, deck archetype, or meta plans for your planned archetype
- Prepares people to upvote on future cards you make
- Displays a level of planning and dedication which will make people believe you when you say you plan to support this
- Makes your cards feel "inevitable," instead of like an experiment you're trying out which can be stopped if early attempts don't make it into the game
- Positive commenters will feel invested in your archetype's progress; negative commenters will provide constructive criticism, and if addressed, may also become invested
- Non-card submission posts get posted in the #player-articles channel in Discord
- An infographic like the one in the Vox post can communicate things more clearly than just text. Large blocks of text are an easy trap to fall into, but thereâ€™s a reason not everyone reads books and news articles are getting shorter.

We also recommend discussing your plans with people in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/c8ftnvt).
Getting at least some interest in your archetype there is a very good sign. The channel #archetype-building is a good spot for this.
