Small Realms are a way to officially group together sets of cards which are connected but don’t need all the baggage of a full Realm. This is a good way to create cycles of cards, similar to "cycles" from other popular card games, if you want to.

- Small realms don’t get any of the "rewards" for completing a normal Realm, except that when players complete a small realm they will be rewarded with 500 gold per card, split evenly among all contributors.

  - If people cynically toss everything they make into small realms of size 2 to get an extra 500 gold out of the process we’ll take out the gold reward.

- You can essentially omit any aspect of a Realm, call it a Small Realm, and have it added to the game. Some examples:

  - Small Realms do not have ages, and cannot have Legendaries.

  - Small Realms don’t have any rarity restrictions; you can make a Small Realm with seven Rares for example.

  - Small Realms don’t need to say they are from a specific realm ("from X"). They can just be a cycle.

  - Small Realms don’t need lore.

- The basic idea is that they’re official ways to codify cycles or other little sets of cards which go together but don’t have a fully fleshed-out backstory.
