If you'd like to make a new card for Collective, you can submit a [Card] post to the [Subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/collectivecg/) made with the in-game or website version of the [Card Creator](/creator). You need an account and a certain amount of progress in game to access the Card Creator.

The top 10 voted card submissions each week are accepted into the game.

## Rules for Submitting New Cards

### 1. No copyright infringement

1.  No cards which mention someone else’s intellectual property, for example a "batman" card.
2.  No clever use of the art editor to visually represent someone else’s intellectual property.
3.  No cards which are too close to a card from another game, for example a card with the exact same name and effect (or suspiciously similar name + effect, or a "parody")
4.  We’re a very small team and not going to take any chances with this.

### 2. No 'inappropriate content'

Collective will be submitted to app stores at a 12\+ or "Teen" rating. Examples of content this excludes:

1.  Pornography. 12\+ rating allows only for mild suggestive content
2.  Excessive profanity
3.  Extreme violence
4.  Basically if it wouldn't show up in other popular mobile games, it’s maybe not suitable for Collective.

### 3. No new cards which nullify core Collective mechanics

No new cards which seek to negate the effects of things unique to collective, including Heroes or the affinity system.

1.  No cards which by design seek to nullify the passives, rewards and other aspects of a specific Hero design or designs. An example card like this: "Whenever Cassiel comes into play, banish her."
2.  No new cards which change the affinity of cards en masse. [Penumbra](https://www.collective.gg/try-out?imgurl=https://files.collective.gg/p/cards/43fe8740-d0d0-11e9-820a-35347609d484-s.png) is the last one.
3.  No new cards which effectively do this without technically changing affinity, for example, by reducing the cost of a card equal to its ticks, or by reducing the costs of all cards in an affinity (Such as [Rainbow Prism](https://www.collective.gg/try-out?imgurl=https://files.collective.gg/p/cards/00e0b250-2b29-11e9-8328-6343e26ccc8e-s.png).)
4.  Updates to existing cards which do things like this will be heavily scrutinized, and rejected if they clearly go beyond their current power level, or are "sidegrades" or other reworks. TL;DR don't buff penumbra.

### 4. No explicitly prejudiced posts

Nothing racist, homophobic, misogynistic, transphobic, etc. Nothing containing or referencing sexual harassment or assault. We'll add to this list if issues come up. Please don't make us do that.

### 5. No cards about modern politics

LGBT+ representation is OK.

### 6. No cards with intentionally misleading text

For example, a unit which says "does nothing" but wins the game if unblocked.

### 7. Cards submitted must be made in the Collective in-game card editor

You cannot use outside image editing tools to create your own cards.

### 8. No cards using existing art, an existing name, or otherwise appearing too similar to an existing card

You cannot submit cards with name or art which is identical or nearly identical to an existing card. Other similarities to existing cards which could confuse someone who is newer to the game are also not allowed. (This is a grey area.)

### 9. No cards which are intentionally designed around surfacing a bug

This means a bug either in the rules engine or in the UI.

For example, cards which multiply a unit's ATK, when used repeatedly, can raise it to very high levels, causing visual bugs, and that's OK. However creating a card which immediately gives a unit 3072 ATK is not allowed because it is designed around an idea that will always cause a UI bug.

### 10. No cards that are designed around a feature that you'd like us to make

If accepted, a card based around a feature which isn't implemented yet will look essentially the same as a bug to any user who doesn't know the story behind the card. So far there has been [one exception](https://files.collective.gg/p/cards/27e10290-dba3-11e8-8e83-c3560f26b7c7-m.png), and it was allowed because the new feature was approved by us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/C8fTNVt) and planned to be released shortly after the card was made. (The new feature was the keyword Agile, which we mentioned before the card was created.)

### 11. No references to the subreddit

This includes mentions of "upvotes," "karma," "meta," "reposts," "OC," etc.

### 12. No cards which violate lore

There are a couple lore limitations based on the setting of Collective which may require your card's background to be changed. This has not happened yet in our first several hundred cards. The big ones are:

1.  Your card can't represent travelling backwards in time
2.  Your card can't canonically have species-, planet- or dimension-destroying abilities or similar abilities of such a power level that they could theoretically destroy the setting of the game.
3.  Full wiki link [here](https://collective.gamepedia.com/Lore_Limitations)

### 13. Your card can't reference more than 13 external cards or any new non-'token' cards

The "no more than 13 external cards" rule means that your card cannot reference more than 13 cards other than itself using the "external card" aspect of the Card Creator. You can see [here](https://www.collective.gg/try-out?imgurl=https://files.collective.gg/p/cards/ff09a570-8481-11e8-8a27-19a1b508c4e9-m.png) an early card which referenced eleven new cards. This rule is baked into the Card Creator itself, so it should not be possible to create a card like this even if you tried.

The second part of this rule refers to "token" cards, which are a colloquial term for cards which are generally made as an effect by another card and cannot be collected or added to your deck via normal means. The "token" term comes from games like Magic: the Gathering, which has cards which make "1/1 soldier tokens," for example. "Token" cards must be given the "Undraftable" rarity, which prevents them from being added to a deck on their own.

- It's fine to make cards which reference other cards which are not Undraftable rarity ([example](https://www.collective.gg/try-out?imgurl=https://files.collective.gg/p/cards/6850a340-884b-11e8-aada-fd6394e05a92-m.png)), but if someone made a card that referenced another card of a rarity other than Undraftable before it had gotten into the game, it would be equivalent to the card and the new card it's referencing being added to the game at the same time.
- Updating a single card which was Undraftable to have a different rarity, making it able to be added to a deck via normal means, is fine.

### 14. No cards which create infinite loops

If an infinite loop is created somehow, the game will draw. Cards which intentionally create infinite loops will not be allowed, and if cards can create infinite loops in combination with each other, we may have to change them if they become a meta staple. This is mostly because infinite loops will impact the performance of the game for all players.

### 15. No malicious posting of someone else's card

We have not yet encountered a situation where someone posts their own alternate version of someone else's card maliciously and gets more upvotes. This could get ugly, especially if they remove the original creators as contributors. The fact this hasn't happened is due to us being a small community of nice people that are friendly with one another. We (the developers) don't know what we'll do when this inevitably happens but it will definitely not just be "the person who posted someone else's card gets all the gold."

### 16. Developers do not have special privileges

The developers of this game, should they wish to add a card to the game, do not get any kind of special treatment. As you can see, [/u/NickCollective](https://old.reddit.com/user/NickCollective/submitted/?sort=top&t=year) (one of the developers) occasionally submits cards and is subject to the same restrictions as players.

## Temporary rules based on current game restrictions

### 1. Mechanics which haven't been implemented yet

1.  Manually triggering "hook" abilities like summon, entomb is not possible yet
2.  Replacement effects
3.  No effects like "if you would draw a card, instead discard a card"
4.  No effects like "if you would take damage, instead you…" \(Including "instead nothing happens"\)
5.  Change of control effects ("gain control of a unit" or "move a unit from your opponent's discard to your in play")

### 2. Use upcoming terminology for 'remove from the game'

We are eventually separating "remove from the game" effects into two terms: "bind" (which removes a card from the game with the intention of it being able to come back – these will show up on hover) and "banish" (completely removed from the game forever). You can assume that effects like [Dust to Dust](https://files.collective.gg/p/cards/eb13d5e0-fd8a-11e8-853e-4fd996be908b-s.png) would use "banish," and as a result you should not make cards which can "choose" and return cards from the entire "removed from game" zone to play. This is because we really want to avoid the "removed from game" zone becoming a "second graveyard" like it is in Magic: the Gathering, leading them to make this [self-deprecating joke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=74231&type=card).

## Last-minute changes

1. If you don’t like your card, just delete your reddit post before we add it into the game at the end of the week and it will not be added. (If you want to resubmit it, just resubmit it with the [Card] tag as if you were submitting it for the first time). Please do not submit a card as an [Update] if it is not in the game already.

2. If you want to make a non\-bug\-related gameplay change to your card after it’s been voted into the game \(such as making it cost 1 more\) we will not accept your change. You have to submit an [Update] to the card to fix it instead.

3. If you realize that a card you've submitted has a bug, please notify us ahead of time. The most reliable way to do this is via a direct message to Nick in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/C8fTNVt). The process around this has caused occasional issues with our community, and we may look to change or formalize it in the future.

**Have fun making those cards!**
