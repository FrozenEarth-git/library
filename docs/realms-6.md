This section comprises some of the rules which hopefully won’t come up often. We included the role of Realm **Realm Admin** out of simplicity, and necessity for someone to have a "final say" on controversial issues. Read only if you are hardcore and care about the details.

Admins of a Realm should ideally not feel as if they are the "leaders" but rather the maintainers of the Realm. Our intention is for Realms to feel like a community effort. This is why no special rewards are given to **Realm Admins** to place them "above" other contributors.

- The main power of the **Realm Admin** is to veto cards.

  - It’s the responsibility of an Realm Admin to contact us if they’d like to veto a card that gets in the week’s cards.

  - If they didn’t notice that a card got in and they want to veto, they have 24 hours after the card is accepted to contact us and have us remove the card. Everyone will be annoyed with you if you do this though.

  - If you veto a card, it would be good to give a reason along with it; we will provide this reasoning in a comment on the card for other people to see. [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/collectivecg/comments/d2jw21/card_n3on_shenlong/ezwnpqs/) was our first veto and we believe it was a great precedent for future vetos.

  - This should probably be obvious but the veto power is best handled by managing your Realm closely while people are suggesting cards. We’re expecting that very, very few cards will actually need to be vetoed, and we’ll be sad if this isn’t the case.

  - Realm Admins can’t veto cards that aren’t submitted as part of their Realm. If someone makes a card that infringes on your Realm’s design space, even if it only affects cards from your realm ("Destroy all Spideropolis Units"), Realm Admins cannot veto it.

  - If an admin is being a total ass for no reason we’ll ban them, but they’d really have to be awful.

- [Cosmetic Update]s of Flavor Text or other non-art aspects can be vetoed by the Realm Admin. To do this, message us before we do card review on friday.

- Realms cannot have more than two Realm Admins. Neither of them can remove each other as Realm Admins. They can, however, give up their own seat at any time, and if they do so the other Realm Admin can choose another one.

  - A list of Realm Admins is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11p9p5MK28z7R7pH1aPVxaHwOvhCmjpxxka1ydURSaH8/edit#gid=0). This list, not whatever other people say, is the only official source for who is an **Realm Admin**. If this is out of date, please contact Nick on [Discord](https://discord.gg/C8fTNVt) and he will update it.

* If you’d like to remove yourself as an Realm Admin or add another user as an Realm Admin you will have to contact us directly.

* If all Realm Admins have not logged into the game for 30 days, someone else can take the Realm over. It’s up to users to identify missing Realm Admins and tell us if they want us to pass the Realm to them; for new Realm Admins, we will always give preference to players who have contributed more cards to the Realms.

* Nobody can administer multiple Realms.

To restate our intention: Realm Admins of a Realm should ideally not feel as if they are the “leaders” but rather the maintainers of the Realm. No special rewards are given to Realm Admins to place them above other contributors.
