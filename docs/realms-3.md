When your Realm completes an Age, it can receive rewards. These differ based on how many Ages your Realm has completed.

As your Realm completes further Ages, the rewards are less well-defined. At the point that you have completed Age II or above, you should come to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/C8fTNVt) and provide feedback and advice on what the rewards should be. We'll listen :)

## Rewards for Completing Ages I-III and Beyond

### Age I

- “Waiting for game” tip in the loading screen

- Bullet points in card creator

### Age II

- **Realm Members** may (if they wish) design and submit a deck as a single player level. Collective Staff will do the final touches on the level to make it balanced and appropriate within the context of the single player content.

  - We’re hoping to add these in semi-regularly (every month or two) but we cannot guarantee to get this in on a specific schedule because it will involve tweaking/balancing the level as well as updating the game.

- At the end of Age II, you can add additional information to your Realm’s lore on the wiki. This can include:

  - Where on the world map your Realm has a “base” (hopefully becomes relevant later, can be used to situate your

  - Descriptions of your Realm’s relationship with other Realms of age II or higher (Alliances, Rivalries)

  - We are thinking about how best to integrate this idea into the game. Check back later for more information on this, or come to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/C8fTNVt) to contribute ideas on how to do this!

- We are open to changing the mechanics or theme of Core Set cards to tie them in with the lore established thus far.

- Essentially after age II your Realm is considered a major aspect of the game; what this means exactly is not decided yet but we are open to ideas :)

### Age III

- Official Icon

  - All cards from your Realm get a watermark behind the body text.

  - Additionally, when we add emojis to the game, finishing Age III will give all players access to an emoji based on your watermark. You can attach an emoji to your username in game like a “badge” to show your support for your favorite Realm. All **Realm Members** will get a special golden version of this icon.

  - Creation of your icon will essentially be sent to us and implemented by hand. **Realm Admins** will be expected to create a relatively simple, black and white (no grey) icon like this:

  ![Example Realm Icon](assets/rocket.png)

  - From this icon we will create a watermark and a custom emoji as long as it’s not a dick or something. If you tell us what you want it to look like we’ll be happy to do it :)

### Age ? (Long term plans)

At some point, we may design one of these new features around your Realm and/or with the **Realm Members**:

- A new Hero from your Realm

- Card back (Psst… Two of these are done already!)
