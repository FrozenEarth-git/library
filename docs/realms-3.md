When your Realm completes an Age, it can receive rewards. These differ based on how many Ages your Realm has completed.

As your Realm completes further Ages, the rewards are less well-defined. At the point that you have completed Age II or above, you should come to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/C8fTNVt) and provide feedback and advice on what the rewards should be. We'll listen :)

## Rewards for Completing Ages I-III and Beyond

### Age I

- “Waiting for game” tip in the loading screen

- Bullet points in card creator

### Age II

- Second “Waiting for game” tip in the loading screen, but this tip must be lore about a rivalry, alliance, battle, or other interaction with some other Realm which has also achieved Age II.

### Age III

- Official Icon

  - All cards from your Realm get a watermark behind the body text.

  - Finishing Age III will give all players access to an emoji based on your watermark.

    - All **Realm Members** will get a special golden version of this icon.

  - Creation of your icon will essentially be sent to us and implemented by hand. **Realm Admins** will be expected to create a relatively simple, black and white (no grey) icon like this:

  ![Example Realm Icon](assets/rocket.png)

  - From this icon we will create a watermark and a custom emoji as long as it’s not a dick or something. If you tell us what you want it to look like we’ll be happy to do it :)

### Age IV

- After achieving Age IV, you can request a permanent change to the world map. When this happens we will contact you with details.

### Age ? (Long term plans)

At some point, we may design one of these new features around your Realm and/or with the **Realm Members**:

- A new Hero from your Realm

- Card back (Psst… Two of these are done already!)
