# Democratic process

### Submitting to the Subreddit

Each week, cards made by the community are added to the game. You can submit cards, too — but might want to read more about the specifics first.

### Rules: New Cards

If you'd like to make a new card for Collective, you can submit a [Card] post to the [Subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/collectivecg/) made with the in-game or website version of the [Card Creator](/creator). You need an account and a certain amount of progress in game to access the Card Creator.

The top 10 voted card submissions each week are accepted into the game.

### Rules: Updates

When a card is too strong, too weak, or should otherwise be changed, you can submit an [Update] to the [Subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/collectivecg/) with a modified version of the card.

The top 3 voted update submissions with more votes than the 10th normal submission each week are accepted. (The max 3 updates have been nicknamed "update slots" by the community.)

### Rules: Commenting

We encourage discussion of balance and design on the [Subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/collectivecg/). In time, your comments will show up in the game as well!

### Rules: New Keywords

Players can create new Keywords by getting enough cards with a prototype version of a Keyword into the game.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Here you can find other information which doesn't fit in any categories, including a more explicit explanation of what aspects of the game are controlled by the developers, and other answers to infrequently asked questions.

# Lore

### Lore

In Collective, players help develop the story. The developers have plans for backstory and plot development, so there need to be limitations on what players can and can't do.

### Wanderstar Lore

Wanderstar is the name of the planet which Collective takes place on. This article is a simplified version of the official lore for the planet and its history.

# Realms (Note: Realms are for advanced users.)

### What are Realms?

Realms are sets of cards that come from the same world and all landed on Wanderstar. Their type line will say "\<Tribe> from \<Realm>," ex: "Spider from Spideropolis."

### Developing your Realm

Creating a Realm is a large task, but luckily, it's designed from the ground up to be a community effort.

This is a list of the steps involved in creating a Realm, finishing the first Age, creating an (optional) **Legendary** card, and what happens if your Realm completes additional ages.

### Age Rewards

When your Realm completes an Age, it can receive rewards. These differ based on how many Ages your Realm has completed.j

### Realm Updates

Realm updates are treated as [Cosmetic Update]s, so they don’t take up any slots. Don’t update other people’s cards and you won’t ever have issues. If you update other people’s cards and Realms, they may get the ability to reject your update.

### Small Realms

Small Realms are a way to officially group together sets of cards which are connected but don’t need all the baggage of a full Realm. This is a good way to create cycles of cards, similar to "cycles" from other popular card games, if you want to.

### Realm Admin Rules

This section comprises some of the rules which hopefully won’t come up often. We included the role of Realm Admin out of simplicity, and necessity for someone to have a "final say" on controversial issues. Read only if you are hardcore and care about the details.
