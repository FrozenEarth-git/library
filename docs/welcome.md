Welcome to the Library! This section of the site has all the official rules for the Democratic Process of Collective.

For a quick intro to the rules, we made a low-budget video you should watch first:

## [Wiki](https://collective.gamepedia.com/Collective_Wiki)

Our [Wiki](https://collective.gamepedia.com/Collective_Wiki) is moderated heavily by the players and is a great companion to the Library, with lots of strategies for specific heroes, cards and decks. If it's not here, you can probably find it on the wiki!

## More about the Library

The Library should be considered the most up-to-date place to find the current rules for creating, updating and voting in Collective (AKA the "Democratic Process.")

We also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/collectivecardgame/library), which makes it easy to suggest changes to the Library. If we are missing something or if you'd like to add something to an FAQ section (for example), you can suggest changes here!
