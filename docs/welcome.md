Welcome to Collective, the Community Created Card Game! All new cards are designed, created, illustrated and voted on by the players. Each week, the top 10 cards with the most upvotes get into the game!

## About the Library

This site has all the official rules for the Democratic Process, and various other rules for making things in Collective. The information here is approved by the developers, and should have up to date information. We also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/collectivecardgame/library), which makes it easy to suggest changes to the Library.

## [Wiki](https://collective.gamepedia.com/Collective_Wiki)

Our [Wiki](https://collective.gamepedia.com/Collective_Wiki) is moderated heavily by the players, and has lots of strategies for specific heroes, cards and decks. If it's not here, you can probably find it on the wiki!
