Realm updates are treated as [Cosmetic Update]s, so they don’t take up any slots. Don’t update other people’s cards and you won’t ever have issues. If you update other people’s cards and Realms, they may get the ability to reject your update.

- We are expecting that it will be very common for someone to make a card without thinking of a Realm, and when it gets in, desire to make a Realm for it. Hopefully these rules will make sure nothing goes awry:

  - We will only allow updates to a card’s Realm from the original submitter of the card being updated, and only if the card has no existing Realm. (Once you’ve established that a card comes from a particular Realm, it cannot be changed.)

  - Realm updates will be treated as cosmetic, even if changing the Realm of a card has small gameplay implications.

- Traditional [Update]s have always been intended to rebalance cards, not redesign them. As a result, no cards in Realms have any sort of special protection against balance updates; all the same rules apply.

- [Cosmetic Update]s of Flavor Text or other non-art aspects can be vetoed by the **Realm Admin** just like new [Card] entries for a realm can be vetoed.

- [Cosmetic Update]s of art are always allowed, but may be denied if the **Realm Admin** makes a good argument that they violate that Realm's lore. "I like the old art and the voters were wrong to upvote this update" is not a good enough reason to reject a cosmetic update to art. Deciding what is a "good argument that the art change violates lore" is ultimately up to the developers, and hopefully it never comes to this.

- In the extremely rare and hopefully nonexistent case of an [Update] or [Cosmetic Update] changing multiple things about a card and being contested by the **Realm Admin** such as an [Update] which changes art, effect, and flavor text, each aspect will be handled separately.

- If two people who collaborated on a card or Realm get into a disagreement we may fall back on the reddit username of the person who submitted the card in question compared to the person who submitted the update. This is getting into a gray area though, and hasn’t come up yet.
