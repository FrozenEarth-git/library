# Collective Library

## Intro

##### What's Collective?

Collective is **The Community Created Card Game.** It's a new kind of digital card game, where players can make their own cards, and which cards get into the game is determined by votes on [the Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/collectivecg).

##### What is this github project?

This is the codebase for a section of the Collective website. The stuff here turns into everything on the website with a url that starts with [/library](https://www.collective.gg/library/).

##### Why is this open source?

Our idea is to make it so this section of the website is available for people to make suggestions and add their own content.

We have an awesome [Discord](https://discord.gg/C8fTNVt) that's really the heart of our community. They design most cards that get into the game as a community and have given us fantastic feedback that has dictated the direction of the game since early 2018.

Making this part of the site open source is part of how we want to expand that small Discord community to everyone.

## What can we do here?

##### Write news articles

The "Discord News Squad" (a group of Discord members who do a weekly roundup of what's happening in the community) can add new blog articles, which will show up at [collective.gg/library/blog/](https://www.collective.gg/library/blog/), as well as on the front page and the upcoming "community" page on our website, as news articles.

Other people can post news articles too! We want the news to feel like a town square, not a centralized television broadcast.

We hope that the ability to post articles directly to our site will make it clear, to both existing and new players, that this game is about the community.

##### Update the rules

Rules for card submission, updates, commenting on the subreddit, Realms, and more can be found in the [Library](https://www.collective.gg/library/rules-subreddit/).

**These rules are a living document.** Just like a political system, the laws need to change as the possibilities expand and the community comes up with new ideas. There's almost no precedent for a game like this (the closest thing probably being open source games or [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/), and we still encounter cards and behaviors which necessitate a new rule.

The rules are extensive, and sometimes we have a hard time keeping track of them all! The added benefit of a public rules system where we address _everything_ is that it will help us keep track of them.

##### Ask and answer FAQ's, especially about the Card Creator

The Card Creator is a powerful and intimidating tool, and we were very happy to find that the community does a great job of teaching themselves about it. You can find Advanced Card Creator Topics [here](https://www.collective.gg/library/card-creator-advanced/), and if you have found something odd or you have a question (and nobody else knows the answer -- and you've asked), please feel free to suggest it as an additional item on the page. Right now it's pretty short, but we have a feeling it'll get a lot bigger soon.

## But I can't code!

That's OK. This project is designed to be easy to work on, even if you don't know how to code.
